# Primary Flight Controls
- Those required to safely control an airplane
1. Aileron
2. Elevator
3. Rudder

Flight controls carefully designed to provide a natural feel and provide tactile cues on airfoil performance

The pilot should feel a difference between:
- Normal flight
- Approaching stall



# Classifications
1. Mechanical
2. Hydro-mechanical
3. Fly-by-Wire

#### Mechanical
- **Most basic desing&&
- Consists of **rods and pulleys**

#### Hydro-mechanical
- Two **independent hydraulic systems** activated by mechanical pushrods, cables and pullleys

#### Fly-by-Wire
- Pilot's commands transmitted from control stick to **electronic signals** to controls surfaces
- There are **no direct hydraulic or mechanical linkages between pilot and flight control surfaces**
